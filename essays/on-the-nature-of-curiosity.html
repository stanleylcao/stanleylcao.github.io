      <p>What does it mean to be curious? It is not merely the desire to know, but the willingness to sit with not-knowing — to hold a question open like a door that leads somewhere you haven't yet mapped.</p>

      <p>Curiosity is often framed as a virtue of the intellect, but I think it is closer to something bodily: a restlessness, a leaning-toward, the way a plant turns without thinking toward light. We don't choose to be curious any more than we choose to be hungry. The question is what we do with the appetite.</p>

      <h2>The Shape of a Question</h2>

      <p>A good question changes shape the longer you hold it. It begins as a point of confusion and slowly becomes a landscape. The mathematician Georg Cantor discovered this when he asked a seemingly simple question about infinity: are all infinities the same size? His answer — that there are infinities larger than other infinities — reshaped the foundations of mathematics.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>The key insight can be stated with surprising economy. If \(S\) is any set, then the power set \(\mathcal{P}(S)\) is strictly larger:</p>

      $$|\mathcal{P}(S)| > |S|$$

      <p>A single inequality, and yet entire worlds open within it. What began as a question about counting became a question about the nature of the infinite — and, by extension, about the limits of thought itself.</p>

      <h2>Curiosity as Practice</h2>

      <p>There is a temptation to think of curiosity as something that produces results: discoveries, papers, innovations. But perhaps the more honest account is that curiosity is its own reward — that the state of wondering is itself a kind of dwelling, a way of being at home in uncertainty.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue.</p>
        <footer>Rainer Maria Rilke, <cite>Letters to a Young Poet</cite></footer>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Rilke's advice is deceptively simple. To love a question is to resist the urge to close it prematurely, to let it live alongside you as a companion rather than a problem to be dispatched. This is harder than it sounds. We are trained to seek answers, to optimize, to converge. Curiosity asks us to diverge — to follow the thread even when we cannot see where it leads.</p>

      <p>And sometimes the thread leads nowhere. Sometimes the question dissolves rather than resolves. But even then, something has changed: we have. The act of wondering leaves a mark, a subtle expansion of the space in which we think and feel and notice.</p>

      <p>Perhaps that is enough.</p>

            Cantor's diagonal argument, first published in 1891, demonstrated that the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite — that is, it cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. This result is sometimes called Cantor's theorem. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a>
